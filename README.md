# Image Classification using CNN

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images, and it can predict the class of an input image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- seaborn

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DreamIsMl/image-classification-cnn.git
    cd image-classification-cnn
    ```


## Usage

1. **Train the CNN model:**

    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

2. **Evaluate the model:**

    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py
    ```

3. **Make predictions on new images:**

    ```bash
    python predict_image.py path/to/your/image.jpg
    ```

## Results

Include any notable results or performance metrics achieved by the trained CNN model.

## Model Architecture

Describe the architecture of your CNN, including the number of layers, types of layers, and activation functions used.
